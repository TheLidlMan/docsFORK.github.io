I recieved this Macbook in a ‘Spares and Repairs’ from eBay. The description said that it made the boot chime but nothing was shown on the screen. The battery had a charge on it so I tried to boot it up, it made the boot up chime and showed a blank screen like the description said so shut it down and had a look inside

When having a look inside I found there was no boot drive, but at the time I didn’t think that was an issue as there was no flashing file logo which is normally shown so didn’t think that was an issue. I took the RAM out and took of the back off the laptop and cleaned out the fan and re-pasted the heatsink. Put it back together and put a SSD into the drive bay and got a copy of MacOS Lion 10.5 and fired it up. It booted up to the USB drive
